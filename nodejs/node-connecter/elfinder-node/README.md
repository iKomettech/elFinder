## elFinder NodeJS Connector

This package allows you to use [elFinder file manager](https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder) with Nodejs.
It currently implements LocalFileStorage only.
Work is being done to allow ftp, ssh and cloud storage compatibility.

## Demo

https://studio-42.github.io/elFinder/

## Installation

```sh
npm install elfinder-node --save
```

or

```sh
yarn add elfinder-node
```

## Usage

This package should be implemented as a middleware for Express server. You can see an example of how this package is used [here](/tests).

Below is a summary of how it is used:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const elFinder = require('elfinder-node');

const roots = [
  {
    driver: elFinder.LocalFileStorage,
    URL: '/uploads/', //Required
    path: '/path/to/dir', //Required
    permissions: { read: 1, write: 1, lock: 0 },
  },
  {
    driver: elFinder.LocalFileStorage,
    URL: '/404/', //Required
    path: 'private', //Required
    permissions: { read: 1, write: 0, lock: 1 },
  },
];

app.use('/connector', elFinder(roots));

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 8000);
```

## Configuration

The connector takes an array of volumes. All volumes are local files and must be created before the connector is initiated

- `driver` [optional] - The volume driver to use. Only LocalFileStorage is implemented at the moment and is the default
- `URL` [Required] - the url which will be used to resolve files
- `path` [Required] - The location of the folder
- `permissions` [optional] - An object containing the file permissions. The permissions will apply to everyone if you use an object as shown in the example above.
  You can also use a custom function which returns an object containing the permissions. This is useful for a multi-user system.

```javascript
permissions: function (path) {
  if (user.canAccess(path)) {
    return { read: 1, write: 1, lock: 0 };
  } else return { read: 0, write: 0, lock: 1 };
};
```
